# Alumni web app

A simple alumni app project by team2 that can be used as a future reference for the university's alumni web-app Although the admin panel part is reverse engineered, the entire web-app is made entirely from scratch.

Front-end repository can be seen [here](https://github.com/Sanjero20/alumni-app-ui). Older version and experiments on this repository can be seen [here](https://github.com/MrAgui/AlumniWeb).
